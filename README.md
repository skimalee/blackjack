## BlackJack

### HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

The object of the game is for the player to get as close to the value of 21 without going over, aka busting. All numeric cards have the same value as the number on it, and all face cards have the value of 10 and the Ace has the value of 1 or 11.

### GETTING STARTED:

### NEXT STEPS:

1. I would love to get the split hand function to work.
2. I would also like to incorporate the feature of Insurance (which allows the player to pay for insurance just in case the dealer has BlackJack).
3. I would also love to incorporate sounds (i.e. chips and money so]unds).
4. I would like to clean up the CSS to make the interface have a more elegant look (specifically the messages/modals).
